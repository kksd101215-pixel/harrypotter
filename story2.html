<header>Incident 2: The Chamber of Secrets</header>
<p>
  A darkness older than time itself slumbered beneath the school in the hidden Chamber of Secrets. When it awoke, it brought fear, venom, and whispers of death. Harry descended into the depths where every shadow could be his last sight. The walls pulsed with malevolent energy as a basilisk slithered unseen, eyes lethal to any who dared gaze. Danger was omnipresent; every sound magnified in terror. He fought with courage and magic that burned like fire against the icy malice surrounding him. Secrets were unveiled in the air thick with peril, and bravery became a weapon sharper than any sword. The echoes of that encounter would haunt every step that followed, shaping the hero he was destined to become.
