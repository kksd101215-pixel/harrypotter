<header>Incident 5: Battle at the Department of Mysteries</header>
<p>
  In the labyrinthine halls of the Department of Mysteries, whispers of secrets and power twisted around every corner. Harry and his allies faced Death Eaters, the air thick with curses, shouts, and the smell of smoke and fear. Prophecies hung like fragile glass, danger pressed from all sides, and time itself seemed to falter in the chaos. Each spell cast, each shield raised, was a desperate cry against fate. Shadows clashed with light, courage met malevolence, and the room trembled with the weight of impending doom. Friends fell, hearts raced, and Harry confronted both the enemy and the fragile line between hope and despair. Every moment was tragedy, every breath defiance, and every heartbeat the sound of a world at war.
