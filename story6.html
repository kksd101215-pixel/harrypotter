<header>Incident 6: The Final Battle at Hogwarts</header>
<p>
  The walls of Hogwarts trembled under the weight of a war that would shape the wizarding world forever. Spells flew like deadly comets, screams and cries echoed through corridors, and the night itself seemed to bleed shadows. Harry faced the darkest magic yet, every heartbeat a drum of defiance against the looming end. Friends fought with courage, enemies struck with malice, and the very air shimmered with tragic fate. Every corner hid peril, every step could be the last, and yet Harry pressed on. Courage became sacrifice, hope became fragile, and darkness sought to consume all. In that decisive night, legends were forged, lives were changed forever, and the world would never be the same. Every spell cast, every life risked, every shadow faced spoke of tragedy, heroism, and the fragile thread that binds destiny.
